I've still got lots of things to say, but it looks like we're running out of time
So I'll compile it down the best I can, I think I'll start with this
I'm incapable of change you are in a constant state of flux
Turning into someone of us would consider new
And while I'll always be the same, you will learn to grow yourself new eyes
One's that do not recognize who I used to be to you
But that's okay, you're busy looking for new life
You're like a satellite: a beacon of hope in the night
But something isn't right, it feels like your system is working against you
Someday all this rusted metal, it'll come for you and get you
Then you'll fall through the sky, only getting faster and hotter
I will be the parachute to guide you safely to the water
And it may not be the you I'm used to, some things remain the same
Like your hair, your touch, your smile, your voice, your eyes
The way you say goodbye
So this goodbye
This is goodbye
So this is goodbye
This is goodbye
This is goodbye
