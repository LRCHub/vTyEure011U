You're making me feel so alone
Your heart is a hard thing to hold
But without it, don't feel like home
'Cause there's nothing I hide anymore, anymore

I'm a ghost, while you're sitting right there on your throne
Zoning the world, like you ain't there, what if I broke?
Would you find all the pieces or go?
Or go

I'm slowly falling down here tonight
Triggers out, there's no safety in this life
And if I let you go, would you
Would you change your mind?

'Cause I miss you, I miss you, I do
All of you, even if I lose
'Cause I miss you, I miss you, I do
All of you, even if I lose

'Cause I miss you (I miss you), I miss you, I do
All of you (all of you), even if I lose
'Cause I miss you (I miss you), I miss you, I do
All of you (all of you), even if I lose

I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do

Would you change your mind?

Would you change your mind?

Would you change your mind?

I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do

I'm slowly falling down here tonight
Triggers out, there's no safety in this life
And if I let you go, would you
Would you change your mind?

'Cause I miss you, I miss you, I do
All of you, even if I lose
'Cause I miss you, I miss you, I do
All of you, even if I lose

'Cause I miss you (I miss you), I miss you, I do
All of you (all of you), even if I lose
'Cause I miss you (I miss you), I miss you, I do
All of you (all of you), even if I lose

I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do
I miss you, I do

Would you change your mind?

Would you change your mind?

Would you change your mind?

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I do
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I do
